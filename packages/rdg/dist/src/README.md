# @ablestack/rdg

## Summary

This is a package from the [reactive-domain-graphs](https://github.com/ablestack/reactive-domain-graphs). This library facilitates building and running graphs of [Reactive Domain Objects](#reactive-domain-objects). A primary use case is connecting GraphQL client libraries (such as [ApolloGraphQL](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)) with reactive client libraries (such as [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/)). However, it can also be useful tool for connecting any source of JSON data reactive client applications.

This library does not exclusively support an _Imperative_ or _Reactive_ coding model. Rather, it acts a bridge from an _Imperative programming model_ of stateful objects to a _Reactive programming model_ of observables and data streams.

## Instructions

See the associated [reactive-domain-graphs github repo](https://github.com/ablestack/reactive-domain-graphs) for usage and configuration information.
